A ', 'DDoS flooding attacks are quite popular with hackers\r\nand they can cause devastating impact on computer\r\nsystems. Smurf attack is a type of flooding attack that\r\ninvolves ICMP protocol, which is known to have brought\r\ndown high profile commercial websites. A computer\r\nsystem running Microsoft’s Windows-XP with Service\r\nPack2 (SP2) security software is designed to drop ICMP\r\npackets by default, which makes one believe that ICMPbased flooding attacks cannot harm a computer system that\r\ndeploys SP2 security software. In this experimental paper,\r\nwe set out to test and measure the effectiveness of the\r\nMicrosoft Windows- XP with SP2 security software in\r\nprotecting a computer system from ICMP-based flooding\r\nattacks in fast Ethernet environment. We simulate Smurf\r\nattacks on a computer system in the controlled lab\r\nenvironment. In these experiments, we measure the\r\nexhaustion of computing resource of a computer system\r\nwith and without Windows-XP SP2 security software. It is\r\nobserved that under Smurf attack, the victim computer\r\ndeploying SP2 security software dropped all ICMP\r\nmessages; nevertheless, the exhaustion of the processor\r\nresource of the computer running the SP2 securitysoftware couldn’t be stopped. Furthermore, it was found\r\ninterestingly that the exhaustion of the processor resource\r\nof the computer system running the SP2 security was much\r\nhigher than that of the computer system that didn’t deploy\r\nSP2 security software. These experiments show that\r\ndropping of ICMP messages by SP2-security software at\r\nthe victim computer is too late of an act in preventing the\r\nadverse effect of the Smurf attack. Once the attack traffic\r\nreaches the victim computer, SP2 security software is\r\nineffective in preventing the resource exhaustion caused by\r\nthe attack, even if it is configured to drop the ICMP\r\nmessages.\r\n', 'sntaram, Ajay Mathur, Subhash V.
